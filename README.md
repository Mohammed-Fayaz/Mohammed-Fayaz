# I'm Fayaz
I'm a software engineer who's been working in the industry for over 4 years. I enjoy programming, math and sports. I'm currently working with an early stage startup building AI agents. I have previously worked with a late stage startup (cleartax) and interned at an investment bank (goldman sachs).

# Sport Programming
I've spent a considerable amount of time doing sport programing on platforms such as codeforces / codechef and solving math oriented programming problems on platforms like project euler.
